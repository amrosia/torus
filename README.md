# torus
This project renders a 3D rotating donut in your terminal using ASCII characters. It applies a simple 3D pipeline (geometry, rotation, projection, and shading) to draw a torus that spins on multiple axes. Perfect for learning about basic 3D math and graphics in Rust, or just having fun watching a donut spin in ASCII.

Features:
- Torus (donut) geometry with easy-to-change variables (major/minor radius, camera distance and more)
- Simple lighting/shading using ASCII characters
- Customizable rotation speeds by adjusting angular increments
- Well-commented Rust code
